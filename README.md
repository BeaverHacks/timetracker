# Hummus Time Tracker

## Project Description
The general idea is to create a visual tool/timeline that will link into the Hackathon Club's official website.

Features:
- Visual timeline with deadlines
- To-do lists for each team and associated functionality (add, delete, complete, deadlines)
- A countdown timer to the end of the hackathon

Advanced Features:
- Data persisting beyond sessions
